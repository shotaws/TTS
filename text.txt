Finally, we compare the performance at the position for leftward direction, which is marked as the star, in the case of the speed of ten kilometers per hour. This position is the point corresponding to the position D in our paper. These graphs are about the median of interarrival time of successfully received packets. The interarrival time is related to communication latency. As communication situation becomes worse, this time will become higher. ÅgNaNÅh means that any packet is not received successfully in a simulation time. Please take a look at the variance. The variance of the proposal is lower than that of conventional one. Then because the packet frequency is one hundred milliseconds, the frequency of about zero-point-one seconds will be highest in the best case. And the frequency of number is lower in our proposal by comparison with conventional protocol. Although not written in this slide, we get the similar results at the position for forward direction. Therefore our proposal is beneficial especially for delay-sensitive applications.
